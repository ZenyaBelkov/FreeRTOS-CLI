### Development of FreeRTOS CLI Interface with UART and Authentication

#### Modular Command-Line Interface for Embedded Systems
Designed and implemented a portable command-line interface (CLI) system using FreeRTOS+CLI over UART. The solution includes task-based architecture, message queues, asynchronous command handling, and user authentication via login/password prompt.

#### Real-Time Task and Queue-Based Command Processing
Utilized FreeRTOS primitives such as tasks and queues to structure command reception and processing. The CLI engine manages incoming data from UART, buffers input with echo support, and dispatches parsed commands for execution.

#### Command Registration and Execution Routing
Implemented a modular interface for CLI command handlers. Each command is registered individually and dynamically processed by the CLI core. Help and system-level commands are supported for debugging and diagnostics.

#### UART Interaction and Synchronization
UART receive logic is driven by a dedicated FreeRTOS task. Input characters are echoed and handled in real time, with support for editing features (backspace, line feed, etc.). Internal synchronization is achieved via queues and semaphores.
